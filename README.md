# Cost-of-Living
Projects to calculate and visualize differences in cost of living between different cities

Python practice and also practice using github

Motivation: 
1. Difficulties comparing salaries between different cities
2. Cost of living calculators from online are subpar (in my opinion) in functionality and visualization

Goals:

In Progress:
1. Rent Calculator - scrape data from online databases
   #TODO: Visualization
   #TODO: 

To Do:
2. Cost of Living Calculator - Still thinking how to implement
